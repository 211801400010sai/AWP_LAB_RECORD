        <h4 style="color: crimson;">INTRODUCTION</h4> 
        <P>Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining 
            thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and 
            communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device.</P>

<h2 style="color:blue;">VLSI Design Flow</h2><br> 
<p>The VLSI IC circuits design flow is shown in the figure below. The various levels of design are numbered and 
    the blocks show processes in the design flow.Specifications comes first, they describe abstractly, the functionality, 
    interface, and the architecture of the digital IC circuit to be designed.</p><br>

<h2 style="color:blue;">VLSI Design - FPGA Technology</h2><br> 
<p>The full form of FPGA is “Field Programmable Gate Array”. It contains ten thousand to more than a million logic 
    gates with programmable interconnection. Programmable interconnections are available for users or designers to 
    perform given functions easily. A typical model FPGA chip is shown in the given figure. There are I/O blocks, 
    which are designed and numbered according to function. For each module of logic level composition, there are 
    CLB’s (Configurable Logic Blocks).</p><br>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Gate Array Design</h2><br> 
<p>The gate array (GA) ranks second after the FPGA, in terms of fast prototyping capability. While user programming 
    is important to the design implementation of the FPGA chip, metal mask design and processing is used for GA. 
    Gate array implementation requires a two-step manufacturing process.</p>
